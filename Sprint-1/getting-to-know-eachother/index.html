        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Anthony and I grew up in and currently live in Plainfield, IL. I'm a student at Lewis University who hopes to graduate in May 2023 
            with a degree in Computer Science. I'm the youngest of two and my older brother Alex enjoys his job working at Petco. His employee discount
            is very welcomed as I just adopted a 1 year old Pyrador dog.  </p> 
        <h3> What I Hope to Learn in This Course </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>The fundamentals of Software Engineering</li>
            <li>Advanced knowledge of web development</li>
            <li>How to work efficiently in teams within Agile</li>
         </ul>
        <h4> My Favorite Hobby / Activity </h4>
        <p> My favorite hobby is reading and learning about historical events and people. Epecially documentaries on Youtube are always something I could
            spend my free time on.
